# Current Phase Focus - ExpatNews

## Active Phase: Phase 2 - Web Scraping Implementation

### Phase 1 COMPLETED ✅

**All objectives achieved:**

- ✅ 5/5 Chinese news sources researched and documented
- ✅ Database schema designed and implemented
- ✅ Project structure established with TypeScript types
- ✅ Reddit API integration strategy documented
- ✅ Comprehensive research documentation completed

### Current Priority Tasks (Phase 2)

- [ ] **Tencent News Scraper** - Beijing section + social engagement metrics
- [ ] **Sina News Scraper** - Trending topics + real-time updates
- [ ] **Anti-Detection Infrastructure** - Proxy rotation, user agents, delays
- [ ] **Reddit API Client** - OAuth2 authentication + subreddit monitoring
- [ ] **Content Processing Pipeline** - Extraction, normalization, deduplication

### Phase-Specific Rules

- Focus on accessible sources first (defer The Paper due to 403 blocks)
- Implement anti-detection measures from the start
- Test each scraper individually before integration
- Document technical challenges and solutions
- Build content processing pipeline incrementally

### Success Criteria for Phase Completion

- Tencent News scraper functional with Beijing content extraction
- Sina News scraper operational with trending topic monitoring
- Reddit API integration collecting expat community content
- Anti-detection system preventing blocks
- Content processing pipeline normalizing data across sources
- Ready to move to Phase 3 (AI-Powered Content Intelligence)

### Implementation Priority Order

1. **Tencent News** - Dedicated Beijing section, social metrics
2. **Sina News** - Trending topics, broad coverage
3. **Reddit API** - Expat community perspectives (parallel development)
4. **NetEase News** - Editorial quality content
5. **Toutiao** - AI-curated trending (advanced anti-detection needed)

### Daily Focus Questions

1. Which scraper implementation will provide the most valuable content?
2. What anti-detection measures are needed for the current source?
3. How can I test scraper functionality without triggering blocks?
4. What content processing challenges need addressing?
