# Current Phase Focus - ExpatNews

## Active Phase: Phase 1 - Content Strategy & Sources Setup

### Current Priority Tasks

### Phase-Specific Rules

- Focus only on Phase 1 tasks from TODO.md
- No premature optimization or advanced features
- Document all API research findings in `/docs/research/`
- Create proof-of-concept implementations before full features

### Success Criteria for Phase Completion

- All Chinese news sources identified and documented
- Basic scraping infrastructure established
- Reddit integration functional
- Database schema supports all planned content types
- Ready to move to Phase 2 (Web Scraping Implementation)

### Context Switching Guidelines

- Only work on Phase 1 tasks
- If Phase 2+ ideas arise, document in `/docs/future-ideas.md`
- Complete current task before exploring new Phase 1 areas
- Update this file when moving to next phase

### Daily Focus Questions

1. What Phase 1 task will have the biggest impact today?
2. What can I complete in the next 30 minutes?
3. What research or decisions are blocking progress?
4. What documentation needs updating based on today's work?
