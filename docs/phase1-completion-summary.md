## Key Achievements

### Research Insights

1. **Geographic Content Strategy**
   - Beijing: Tencent News has dedicated section
   - Shanghai: Requires keyword-based filtering across all sources
   - Combined approach: dedicated sections + keyword filtering + location tags

2. **Technical Implementation Requirements**
   - Anti-bot measures vary by source (Tencent most sophisticated)
   - JavaScript rendering required for Sina/Tencent
   - Social engagement data available from Tencent
   - Traditional HTML structure easier with NetEase

3. **Content Differentiation Strategy**
   - Sina: Trending topics, real-time updates
   - Tencent: Social engagement, Beijing focus, multimedia
   - NetEase: Editorial quality, comprehensive analysis

### Database Architecture

- Designed for scalability with proper indexing
- Supports AI processing workflow
- Geographic relevance tracking
- Social engagement metrics
- Content deduplication system
- Multi-language support (Chinese/English)

### Development Foundation

- Type-safe development environment
- Comprehensive source configurations
- Organized project structure following T3 Stack conventions
- Ready for Phase 2 implementation

## Phase 1 Success Metrics

- ✅ **3/5 Chinese sources researched and documented** (60% complete)
- ✅ **Database schema designed and implemented** (100% complete)
- ✅ **Basic project structure established** (100% complete)
- 🔄 **Reddit integration research** (Pending - next session)
- 🔄 **All findings documented** (80% complete)

## Ready for Phase 2

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 2 Preparation)

1. **Complete remaining source research** (Toutiao, The Paper)
2. **Reddit API integration research**
3. **Social media monitoring strategy documentation**

### Phase 2 Implementation Priority

1. **Tencent News Scraper** - Beijing section + social metrics
2. **Sina News Scraper** - Trending topics + broad coverage
